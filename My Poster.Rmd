# **Morphological Analysis of Birds in the Atlantic Forest of South America**

## Introduction

-   **Allen's Rule**: body surface area to volume ratio for animals varies with the average temperature of a creature's habitat  (Allen A, 1877)​

-   The lower the surface area, the less heat can escape, so animals at higher altitudes should have less surface area and a higher body mass​

-   There have been many studies that support Allen's Rule (Landmann A, Winding N, 1995, Blackburn T, Ruggiero A, 2001, Lamichhaney S, Han F, Berglund J, Wang C, Almén MS, Webster MT, Grant BR, Grant PR, Andersson L, 2016, Sun Y, Li M, Song G, Lei F, Li D, Wu Y, 2017)

-   However, some studies have shown this rule to be inaccurate (Alho J, et al. 2010)​

-   We set out to test **Allen's Rule** using an existing data set of bird morphological traits

## Methods

-   The Atlantic Forest is located mostly on the East coast of Brazil, with some of it stretching into Argentina and Paraguay.

​Our data came from **The Atlantic Bird's Data Set**; a data set of bird morphological traits and locations complied over decades by many scientists through museum collections, online data bases, published sources, and unpublished reports for data analysis (Hasui E, et al. 2017). It includes data from **72,483 individual birds** and **780 species**​.

## Results

-   Using R and R Studio (RStudio Team, 2019) along with the packages

-   tidyverse (Wickham *et al*., 2019), ggrepel (Slowikowski *et al.*, 2021), and performance (Lüdecke, Ben-Shachar, Patil, Waggoner, Makowski, 2021), we examined this data.

-   We use the length to mass ratio as a proxy for body surface-area-to-volume ratio

-   We used R in addition to the Tidyverse and Ggrepel packages to graph and analyze this data to compare the length to mass ratio of these birds vs altitude at which the specimen was found.

-   We later focused on just the order Passeriformes, and then narrowed it down even farther to just the genus Turdus to try and get a more accurate result.

    ###### Image 6: A photo of a Rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), an example of a species in the Turdus g (Photo by Charles J. Sharp)

-   I then wanted to explore if wing length was affected by altitude, as some researchers have found in other studies (Landmann and Winding, 1995) as well as bill length (Symonds, Tattersall, 2010).

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Length Mass Ratio vs Altitude
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = length_mass_ratio, 
    x = altitude)) +
  labs(x = "Altitude",
       y = "Length:Mass")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 24) 
```

###### Figure 1: A scatterplot of altitude vs length to mass ratio

We ran our mass to length ratio with altitude and found we had very messy data

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Wing Length vs Altitude (color)
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = length_mass_ratio, 
    x = altitude, 
    color = Order),
    alpha = 0.4
  )
```

###### Figure 2: A scatterplot of the altitude to length mass ratio, witch each order being represented by a different color

We then looked at the same graph but with each order represented by a color and still did not see any major correlations.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
#testing for normal distribution of length_mass_ratio
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0)
```

###### Figure 3: A frequency chart of all length mass ratios (lmr) from our data, which shows a strong right skew.

```{r}
#seperate by order
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~Order, ncol = 5)
```

###### Figure 4: Frequency charts of length_mass_ratio (lmr) separated out by orders.

As we can see, our data in Figure 3 has a strong right skew. To correct for this, we took the natural log of this data. We also separated out each order to see if any specific one was greatly affecting the skew.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#log of length_mass_ratio to correct right skew 
length_vs_mass <-mutate(length_vs_mass, ln_lmr = log(length_mass_ratio))

#testing for normal distribution of ln_lmr
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = ln_lmr), bins = 100)+ 
  facet_wrap(~Order)
```

###### Figure 5: Frequency charts for the log of the lmr, separated out by order.

In Figure 4 and 5, the majority of our data seems to come from one order, the Passeriformes (song birds). A few other groups (such as Anseriformes (waterfowl)) could be skewing our data. Because of this, we decided to focus on just this one group.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#mean of ln_lmr vs altitude 
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(Genus == "Turdus") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude,
    color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlim(c(0,1700))
```

###### Figure 6: A geom_smooth graph comparing altitude to ln_lmr, which each color representing a different species in the genus Turdus

Examining the log of the lmr vs altitude for each species in the genus Turdus, we were able to see a very slight positive correlation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
    altitude > 1000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

###### Figure 7 and 8: Two scatter plots of the log of mean lmr for each species in the family Furnariidae. Figure 7 goes into more detail and exmines this group from only above 1000 m. The blue line in both graphs is a regression line using geom_smooth.

We also looked at the ln(lmr) vs altitude for another group under Passeriformes (the family Furnariidae), we did not see much of a correlation. However, when we examined this family from above an altitude of 1000 meters, we can clearly see a positive correlation between the log of the lmr and altitude.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
passeriformes_means<-
  length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(!is.na(altitude), !is.na(ln_lmr)) %>% 
  group_by(Order, Family, Genus, Species) %>% 
  summarize(
    ln_lmr = mean(ln_lmr),
    altitude = mean(altitude)
  )  
mean_hilo <-
  passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
  group_by(hilo) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(ln_lmr),
    # sd = sd(ln_lmr, na.rm = TRUE),
    # sem = sd(ln_lmr)/sqrt(n()),
    # upper = ln_lmr + 2*sem,
    # lower = ln_lmr - 2*sem
  )

passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ln_lmr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean), data = mean_hilo,
             linetype = "dashed", size = 2, color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ hilo, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")

```

###### Figure 9: two frequency charts for the ln(lmr) for all species in the order Passeriformes both above and below an altitude of 1000 meters. The red line indicates the mean of each set of data.

We examined the counts of lmr for all passeriformes species both above and below 1000 m and we could clearly see that there was a difference in the two means.

```{r, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
  t.test(ln_lmr ~ hilo, data = .)
#antilog of hi
exp(2.067247)

#antilog of low
exp(1.647261)
```

The mean lmr of birds found above 1000 m = 7.9 while the mean lmr of birds found below 1000 m = 5.2. A Welch's Two Sample t-test found t(76) = 3.6, p =0.0005.

After our inital presentation, I then went to use similar methods to examine the birds' wing and beak lengths compared to altitudes.

```{r, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Wing Length vs Altitude (color)
ggplot(data = bird_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = wing_length_mm,
    x = altitude,
    color = Order),
    alpha = 0.4)
```

###### Figure 10: A scatter plot comparing altitude to wing length in mm. Each Order is represented by a different color

Plotting out altitude vs wing length did not immediately show any correlation. I then wanted to look at these values for the family Furnariidae in the Order Passeriformes, as we had done for LMR. After taking the log of these values once again, I examined them in a scatter plot with a best fit line.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#fit line of passeriformes: furnariidea wings
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_wings, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")


#fit line of passeriformes: furnariidae altitude >1000 wings
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
    altitude > 1000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_wings, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

###### Figures 11 and 12: A scatterplot with a best fit line for altitude vs the log of wing length for Passeriformes. Figure 12 shows the correlation above 1000 m.

Overall, wing length seemed to have little to no correlation in relation to altitude, and if anything, also showed a positive correlation. This was similar to our LMR data.

I then examined bill length.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Bill Length vs Altitude (color)
ggplot(data = bird_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = bill_length,
    x = altitude,
    color = Order),
    alpha = 0.4)

```

###### Figure 13: A scatter plot comparing altitude to bill length, each order being represented by a different color

Immediately, there wasn't much of a correlation. However, after I once again narrowed it down to Passeriformes in the family Furnariidae and took the natural log, I did get interesting results.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#geom smooth ln_bills vs altitude
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_bills, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

###### Figure 14: A scatterplot with a best fit line for altitude vs the log of bill length for Passeriformes

Unlike our other examinations, bill length actually did seem to have a negative correlation, as we should expect to see as per Allen's Rule.

## Discussion

-   We predicted length mass ratio would decrease with elevation however, our analysis and t-test show an increase in length mass ratio with an increase in elevation​

-   This is the exact **opposite** of what we would expect to see according to **Allen's Rule** ​

-   Wing length also seemed to have an oppisite effect than what had been expected.

-   Other studies have found similar results that contradict **Allen's Rule** and suggest that the body surface area to volume ratio has a genetic basis rather than an environmental one (Alho J, et al. 2010).

-   Bill length, on the other hand, did seem to follow what was expected according to Allen's rule

-   Allen's rule typically does look at extremity length, so it is interesting to see the bill's seemingly being affected here

-   It is also interesting that LMR and wing length did not seem to follow this rule

-   In future studies, we would be very interested in exploring the reason these birds do not seem to follow Allen's Rule. For example, if we were able to find out which bird species are migratory and then exclude them from the data to just look at permanent species and see if they follow the rule.

-   It would also be interesting to explore why Allen's Rule overall, seems to be applicable in some regions, but not others, as well in certain characteristics over others.
