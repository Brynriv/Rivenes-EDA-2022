# **Morphological Analysis of Birds in the Atlantic Forest of South America**

Casey Perkins, Bryn Rivenes

## Introduction

-   **Allen's Rule**: body surface area to volume ratio for animals varies with the average temperature of a creature's habitat  (Allen A, 1877)​

-   The lower the surface area, the less heat can escape, so animals at higher altitudes should have less surface area and a higher body mass​

-   There have been many studies that support Allen's Rule (LIST SOURCES)

-   However, some studies have shown this rule to be inaccurate (Alho J, et al. 2010)​

-   We set out to test **Allen's Rule** using an existing data set of bird morphological traits

## Methods

-   The Atlantic Forest is located mostly on the East coast of Brazil, with some of it stretching into Argentina and Paraguay.

-   ​Our data came from **The Atlantic Bird's Data Set**; a data set of bird morphological traits and locations complied over decades by many scientists through museum collections, online data bases, published sources, and unpublished reports for data analysis (Hasui E, et al. 2017). It includes data from **72,483 individual birds** and **780 species**​.

-   Using R and R Studio along with the packages tidyverse and ggrepel, we examined this data.

-   We use the length to mass ratio as a proxy for body surface-area-to-volume ratio

-   We used R in addition to the Tidyverse and Ggrepel packages to graph and analyze this data to compare the length to mass ratio of these birds vs altitude at which the specimen was found.

-   We later focused on just the order Passeriformes, and then narrowed it down even farther to just the genus Turdus to try and get a more accurate result.

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Length Mass Ratio vs Altitude
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = length_mass_ratio, 
    x = altitude)) +
  labs(x = "Altitude",
       y = "Length:Mass")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 24) 
```

###### Figure 1: We ran our mass to length ratio with altitude and found we had very messy data

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Wing Length vs Altitude (color)
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = length_mass_ratio, 
    x = altitude, 
    color = Order), 
  )
```

###### Figure 2: We then looked at the same graph but with each order represented by a color and still did not see any major correlations.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
#testing for normal distribution of length_mass_ratio
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0)
```

###### Figure 3: A frequency chart of all length mass ratios (lmr) from our data, which shows a strong right skew. 

```{r}
#seperate by order
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~Order, ncol = 5)
```

###### Figure 4: Frequency charts of length_mass_ratio (lmr) separated out by orders. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#log of length_mass_ratio to correct right skew 
length_vs_mass <-mutate(length_vs_mass, ln_lmr = log(length_mass_ratio))

#testing for normal distribution of ln_lmr
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = ln_lmr), bins = 100)+ 
  facet_wrap(~Order)
```

###### Figure 5: Frequency charts for the log of the lmr, separated out by order. 

As we can see from Figure 4 and 5, the majority of our data seems to come from one order, the Passeriformes. A few other groups (such as Anseriformes) could be skewing our data. Because of this, we decided to focus on just this one group.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#mean of ln_lmr vs altitude 
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(Genus == "Turdus") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude,
    color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlim(c(0,1700))
```

###### Figure 6: Examining the log of the lmr vs altitude for each species in the genus Turdus, we were able to see a slight positive correlation. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
    altitude > 1000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

###### Figure 6 and 7: Two scatter plots of the log of mean lmr for each species in the family Furnariidae. Figure 7 goes into more detail and exmines this group from only above 1000 m. The blue line in both graphs is a regression line using geom_smooth. 

We also looked at the ln(lmr) vs altitude for another group under Passeriformes (the family Furnariidae), we did not see much of a correlation. However, when we examined this family from above an altitude of 1000 meters, we can clearly see a positive correlation between the log of the lmr and altitude.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
passeriformes_means<-
  length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(!is.na(altitude), !is.na(ln_lmr)) %>% 
  group_by(Order, Family, Genus, Species) %>% 
  summarize(
    ln_lmr = mean(ln_lmr),
    altitude = mean(altitude)
  )  
mean_hilo <-
  passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
  group_by(hilo) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(ln_lmr),
    # sd = sd(ln_lmr, na.rm = TRUE),
    # sem = sd(ln_lmr)/sqrt(n()),
    # upper = ln_lmr + 2*sem,
    # lower = ln_lmr - 2*sem
  )

passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ln_lmr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean), data = mean_hilo,
             linetype = "dashed", size = 2, color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ hilo, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")

```

###### Figure : two frequency charts for the ln(lmr) for all species in the order Passeriformes both above and below an altitude of 1000 meters. The red line indicates the mean of each set of data. 

We examined the counts of lmr for all passeriformes species both above and below 1000 m and we could clearly see that there was a difference in the two means.

```{r, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
  t.test(ln_lmr ~ hilo, data = .)
#antilog of hi
exp(2.067247)

#antilog of low
exp(1.647261)
```

The mean lmr of birds found above 1000 m = 7.9 while the mean lmr of birds found below 1000 m = 5.2. A Welch's Two Sample t-test found t(76) = 3.6, p =0.0005.

## Discussion

-   We predicted length mass ratio would decrease with elevation however, our analysis and t-test show an increase in length mass ratio with an increase in elevation​

-   This is the exact **opposite** of what we would expect to see according to **Allen's Rule** ​

-   Other studies have found similar results that contradict **Allen's Rule** and suggest that the body surface area to volume ratio has a genetic basis rather than an environmental one (Alho J, et al. 2010).

-   In future studies, we would be very interested in exploring the reason these birds do not seem to follow Allen's Rule. For example, if we were able to find out which bird species are migratory and then exclude them from the data to just look at permanent species and see if they follow the rule.

-   It would also be interesting to explore why Allen's Rule overall, seems to be applicable in some areas, but not others.
